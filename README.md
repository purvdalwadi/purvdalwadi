Hi, I’m Purv Dalwadi, a Computer Engineering student passionate about crafting scalable web solutions and solving real-world problems through code. I’m driven by the challenge of turning complex ideas into clean, functional, and high-performing applications.

As a Full-Stack Developer, I work comfortably across the entire stack. My current toolbox includes:

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS

Database: MongoDB

🧠 I’m constantly pushing myself to grow — right now, I’m diving deeper into AWS and Next.js to broaden my development capabilities.

🚧 One project I’m especially proud of is SkillForge, a full-stack platform I helped build and lead. It was a hands-on experience in team collaboration, leadership, and full-cycle development — and it fueled my hunger for more challenging builds.

🤝 I’m always open to collaborating on exciting projects, exchanging knowledge, and connecting with like-minded developers who are just as passionate about tech as I am.
